The Gesture and Voice-Controlled Media Player is an AI-driven system that enables fully touch-free interaction using hand gestures and voice commands.

Key technologies include:

Computer Vision (OpenCV + Mediapipe) for capturing hand landmarks

CNN-based Gesture Classification Model for recognizing gestures

Speech Recognition for audio-based commands

Python GUI for media playback

This project demonstrates applied AI engineering, real-time processing, and multimodal user interaction.
